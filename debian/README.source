Debian build script
===================

Instead of packaging node-rollup with all of its dependencies, we recreate its
output here using a hacky sed-based Makefile, debian/main.mk.

When updating to the next upstream version, you should ensure that the final
output of diff as run by `debian/rules compare-upstream` is blank.
